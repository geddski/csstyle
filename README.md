Clean, simple, for styling the web.

Check out the docs and examples on [csstyle.io](http://csstyle.io)


## Getting Started
1. make sure you have the latest stable SASS (3.4).

2. Add `id="csstyle"` to your html or body element. This is necessary so that components with their
parts and options can nest indefinitely yet always be overridden by tweaks and locations.

3. Download the csstyle mixins and `@import` them into your sass file.

    You can download the mixins from npm
    ```
    npm install csstyle
    ```

    or from bower
    ```
    bower install csstyle
    ```

Now you can start creating components with options & parts, adding in tweaks and locations as needed.

## FAQ

### How do parts react to component states like hover?
In Sass you can append a `&` to a selector or pseudo-selector to have it applied to the parent context. So for example to have a `part` react when the `component` gets hovered:

```scss
@include component(capacitor){
  background: red;
  
  @include part(flux){
    background: orange;
    :hover & {
      background: blue;
    }
  }
}
```

### Can I configure the styling convention?
You can configure which symbol is used to denote `parts` by changing the `$csstyle-part-symbol` variable. The default is `__` but you can set it to `-` or whatever suits your style.

- ship mixins as gem
- support stylus, rework, and less once API is solid
